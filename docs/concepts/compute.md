# 0G Compute Network: Decentralized AI Computing

In today's world, AI models are transforming industries, driving innovation, and powering new applications. However, running advanced AI models for your application faces several obstacles:
- **High Costs**: Enterprise AI services require significant monthly commitments
- **Complex Setup**: Cloud GPU configuration requires technical expertise
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Limited flexibility when switching providers

**The result?** AI computing remains inaccessible for many developers and startups.

## What is 0G Compute?
0G Compute is a decentralized framework that provides AI computing capabilities to our community. It forms a crucial part of deAIOS. 0G Compute is a decentralized marketplace where GPU owners sell computing power to developers who need it - think Uber for AI computing.

**Key difference**: Instead of renting from AWS/Google with high costs and lock-in, you access a global GPU network that's 90% cheaper with pay-per-use pricing.

## How It Works

### For AI Users

1. **Deposit Funds**: Pre-fund your account with pay-as-you-go credits
2. **Request Service**: Send your AI request (inference, training, etc.)
3. **Get Results**: Receive output from the best available GPU
4. **Automatic Payment**: Pay only for actual compute used

### For GPU Owners

1. **Register Hardware**: List your GPU specs and availability
2. **Set Your Price**: Competitive marketplace pricing
3. **Process Requests**: Automatic job allocation
4. **Instant Earnings**: Get paid immediately upon completion

### Technical Implementation
- **Smart Contract Escrow**: Funds secured until service delivery
- **Signed Transactions**: Cryptographic verification of all interactions
- **ZK-Proof Settlement**: 100x lower transaction costs through compressed proofs

<summary>**What makes it trustless?**</summary>

Like eBay with automatic escrow - the smart contract ensures:
- Payment only after service delivery
- Both parties must fulfill obligations  
- No intermediary can interfere

This means no one can censor your AI usage, freeze your account, or change terms suddenly.
