# INFTs: Tokenizing AI Agents

## What Are INFTs?

The rapid growth of AI agents necessitates new methods for managing their ownership, transfer, and capabilities within Web3 ecosystems. 

**INFTs (Intelligent Non-Fungible Tokens)** represent a significant advancement in this space, enabling the tokenization of AI agents with:

- **Transferability**: Move AI agents between owners securely
- **Decentralized control**: No single point of failure
- **Full asset ownership**: Complete control over AI capabilities
- **Royalty potential**: Monetize AI agent usage and transfers

## Why Traditional NFTs Don't Work for AI

Traditional NFT standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155 have significant limitations when applied to AI agents:

### Key Problems

**🔓 Static and Public Metadata**
- Existing standards link to static, publicly accessible metadata
- AI agents need dynamic metadata that reflects learning and evolution
- Sensitive AI data requires privacy protection

**🚫 Insecure Metadata Transfer**
- ERC-721 transfers only move ownership identifiers
- The underlying AI "intelligence" doesn't transfer
- New owners receive incomplete or non-functional agents

**🔒 No Native Encryption**
- Current standards lack built-in encryption support
- Proprietary AI models remain exposed
- Sensitive user data can't be protected

## The INFT Solution: ERC-7857

ERC-7857 is a new NFT standard specifically designed to address AI agent requirements. It enables the creation, ownership, and secure transfer of INFTs with their complete intelligence intact.

### Revolutionary Features

**🛡️ Privacy-Preserving Metadata**
- Encrypts sensitive AI "intelligence" data
- Protects proprietary information from exposure
- Maintains privacy throughout transfers

**🔄 Secure Metadata Transfers**
- Both ownership AND encrypted metadata transfer together
- Verifiable transfer process ensures integrity
- New owners receive fully functional agents

**⚡ Dynamic Data Management**
- Supports evolving AI agent capabilities
- Secure updates to agent state and behaviors
- Maintains functionality within NFT framework

**🌐 Decentralized Storage Integration**
- Works with 0G Storage for permanent, tamper-proof storage
- Distributed access management
- No single point of failure

**✅ Verifiable Ownership & Control**
- Cryptographic proofs validate all transfers
- Oracle-based verification ensures integrity
- Transparent ownership verification

**🤖 AI-Specific Functionality**
- Built-in agent lifecycle management
- Pre-execution ownership verification
- Specialized features for AI use cases

## How INFT Transfers Work

The transfer mechanism ensures both token ownership and encrypted metadata transfer securely together.

### Simple Transfer Flow

```
1. 📦 Encrypt & Commit    →  2. 🔄 Oracle Processing
          ↓                           ↓
6. ✅ Access Granted     ←  3. 🔐 Re-encrypt for Receiver
          ↑                           ↓
5. ✓ Verify & Finalize   ←  4. 🗝️ Secure Key Delivery
```

<details>
<summary><b>Detailed Step-by-Step Process</b></summary>

1. **Encryption & Commitment**
   - AI agent metadata gets encrypted
   - Hash commitment created as authenticity proof
   - Content remains hidden

2. **Secure Transfer Initiation**
   - Trusted oracle (using TEEs) decrypts original metadata
   - Process happens in secure environment

3. **Re-encryption for Receiver**
   - Oracle generates new encryption key
   - Re-encrypts metadata with new key
   - Stores new encrypted metadata (e.g., on 0G Storage)

4. **Key Delivery**
   - New encryption key encrypted with receiver's public key
   - Only intended owner can access metadata key

5. **Verification & Finalization**
   - Smart contract verifies multiple proofs:
     - Sender's access rights
     - Oracle validation of metadata matching
     - Receiver's signed acknowledgment
   - If valid: ownership transfers + receiver gets encrypted key

6. **Access Granted**
   - Receiver uses private key to decrypt metadata key
   - Full access to agent's encrypted intelligence granted
