Welcome to the 0G Faucet – your gateway to obtaining testnet tokens for the 0G network!

## What is the 0G Faucet?

The 0G Faucet provides free testnet tokens, essential for interacting with the 0G testnet. Whether you're running a node, utilizing our storage or data availability (DA) network, you'll need these tokens to test and explore the 0G environment without using real cryptocurrency.

## How to Get Testnet Tokens
- **Use the Faucet Website:** The easiest way to request tokens is through our [Official Faucet](https://faucet.0g.ai), [Hub Faucet](https://hub.0g.ai/faucet). Each user can receive up to 0.1 OG token per day, which is sufficient for most testing needs.


- **Request via Discord:** If you require more than 0.01 OG token per day, please reach out in our vibrant [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/0glabs) to request additional tokens.

:::important 
- Testnet tokens have no real-world value and are for testing purposes only.
- Ensure you have an EVM-compatible wallet to receive 0G testnet tokens. An example of such is [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/)
- There may be a limit to how often you can request tokens.
- If you encounter any issues, please reach out to our support team on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/0glabs).
