# 0G: The First Decentralized AI Operating System (dAIOS)

## What is Zero Gravity (0G)? 

Zero Gravity (0G) is a decentralized AI operating system that acts as the foundational layer for decentralized AI applications. It efficiently manages hardware resources such as storage and computation to handle the scale and complexity of AI workflows. 

As the blockchain explicitly designed for AI, 0G features an infinitely scalable data availability (DA) layer, modular storage system, and a flexible serving framework. As the only chain capable of managing vast volumes of data, 0G bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3, bringing previously impossible use cases to reality.

The 0G operating system has 4 key components: 
- 0G Storage: A distributed storage network optimized for massive data loads.
- 0G DA: An infinitely scalable and programmable data availability layer designed for end-users.
- 0G Serving: A versatile framework for data retrieval, AI inference, and model training.
- 0G Chain: The fastest, most modular blockchain, making on-chain gaming and AI a reality.

> What is decentralized storage?
Decentralized storage distributes data across multiple network nodes rather than relying on a central server. This approach enhances data security, resilience, and accessibility by eliminating the single point of failure common in centralized systems.

> What is data availability?
Data availability guarantees that data stored within the system is readily accessible and retrievable whenever required. 0G's data availability network employs erasure coding and a quorum-based attestation system to ensure data remains available even in scenarios where some nodes might fail.

> What is an AI serving framework?
An AI serving framework is a system that facilitates the deployment and execution of AI models. 0G's decentralized serving network supports data retrieval, AI inference, and model training, ensuring efficient resource management for AI applications.

> What is a modular blockchain?
A modular blockchain is one where each layer or component is specialized for a particular function, improving scalability and flexibility. 0G Chain uses this architecture to optimize its components, allowing for independent optimization of consensus, execution, and chain storage. This modular architecture enables each component to be fine-tuned for its specific requirements, resulting in enhanced performance ,scalability, and flexibility for decentralized AI applications. 

All of these network components utilize carefully designed and innovative sharding mechanisms to achieve infinite horizontal scalability, thereby removing obstacles to the true democratization of AI. 

0G’s novel approach to decoupling data availability from consensus allows independent scaling of storage and validation layers. This architecture not only addresses the scalability challenges faced by traditional blockchain systems, but also enhances data resilience and retrieval efficiency. 

On Newton Testnet, each 0G node demonstrated 10mbps throughput. With 5,000 nodes, that’s 50,000mbps or 50gbps per consensus layer. As the consensus layer becomes the bottleneck, 0G plans to implement its own custom consensus (currently using Tendermint), akin to adding more AWS servers in a Web2 context, ultimately enabling infinite throughput.

## 0G’s Origin Story

“0G” gets its name from “Zero Gravity,” personifying the ultimate goal of achieving a state of weightlessness where transactions and data exchanges can occur effortlessly. Infrastructure should be customizable for developers and invisible to the end-user. 

With 0G’s technology, the possibilities are endless. Previously infeasible use cases are now within reach, including: 
On-chain AI, including training large language models (LLMs)
Storage of entire AI agent networks on-chain
Storage of large datasets for data cleaning and labeling

And this is just the beginning.
