Only persons who meet the requirements for the sale are allowed to participate. KYC will be required from the purchaser before any receival of rewards.

### Can I run multiple nodes?​

### How Do Rewards for Alignment Nodes Compare with Other Nodes?
Alignment Nodes are expected to offer higher reward rates due to their unique responsibilities, limited supply, and operational requirements compared to storage or validator nodes.
### Are Multiple NFTs Supported per Server?
Yes, users may operate multiple NFTs on a single server, with allowances for connecting and managing several nodes under one setup.
### How Will KYC Impact Reward Claims?
KYC is mandatory for claiming rewards but not required for the initial purchase. This measure ensures that participants meet regulatory requirements before accessing any earned rewards.

## Whitelist & Node Sale
### What is the whitelist (WL)?​
Whitelist is a pre-approved list of participants who are given exclusive access to certain privileges during a sale event. This system is used to reward and incentivize key contributors, partners, or early supporters of a project.

### Does entering the whitelist guarantee that I can definitely purchase a node?​
Your whitelist guarantees an allocation during the Whitelist sale period (Nov 11 - Nov 13). If a purchase is not made within this period, your allocation will be released.

### How to join the whitelist?​
To get a whitelist spot for the 0G Foundation Node Sale, community members and ecosystem participants are eligible for allocations, please visit 0G X and Discord for ways to receive a whitelist. You can also apply for a whitelist spot by filling out the whitelist form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZSiIn3WBEdztzCObFBnLa0c6f1YoRwlN_eI8NxGPuG4w-zg/viewform).

## Payment & Licenses
### What payment methods will be accepted for purchasing a node?​
The nodes will be priced in wETH on Arbitrum. However, to facilitate payment for users on different chains, the Alignment Node Sale will be accepting multiple tokens across multiple networks through a live bridging aggregator that accepts multichain payment including but not limited to BTC, ETH, ARB, SOL, etc. More info [here](https://docs.li.fi/list-chains-bridges-dex-aggregators-solvers).

### How will the node licenses be distributed?​
After the node sale period is completed, node licenses will be distributed as an NFT to the purchase wallet of the user.

### What will I receive from participating in the node sale?​
You will receive a soulbound NFT (ERC-721) which represents your Node License. The NFTs will be minted and transferred to your wallet after the conclusion of the node sale. You will be able to operate the node after 0G Mainnet is live.

## Node Operations
### What are the hardware requirements?​
0G Foundation’s AI Alignment nodes are designed for adoption - they can be run on community members’ laptops, desktops, mobiles, or even on cloud instances.

### How do I run a node? Is it complicated?​
Running a node can be quite straightforward and easy, typically involving just a few steps. We will soon provide a video tutorial to guide you through the process. If you prefer not to manage the node yourself, you can delegate to other node operators with just a single click through our explorer, which will be available shortly.

### Will the sale be accessible from other platforms?​
Both Public and Whitelist sale will be available soon [here](https://node.0gfoundation.ai/) except for Partnered Launchpads, in which case the front end will be on 0G Partners' website.
